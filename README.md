 i'm usually sitting afk with my friends or by myself, c+h is fine and i don't mind interactions!! keep in mind i am very shy though

 most of the time i am off-tab so if you want to talk/interact please whisper me! it may take me a bit to get to your message

 **basic dni** don't interact w/ me if ur racist, transphobic, homophobic, a proshipper, ect

 my current interests are phighting, mortal kombat, pokemon, **SEALS** and much more!! if u like any of these things plz feel free 2 talk 2 me abt them .. :-3

 i am a very awkward person and i struggle with mood swings frequently - please try to be patient w/ me!!! i struggle with interaction but i'm still very down to talk and hangout with people!
